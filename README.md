## Introduction

Welcome to the Visa Scheduling Bot project! This README provides an overview of the project along with information on how to access a video demonstration. Please note that the source code for this project is hosted in a private repository due to legal regulations and the presence of sensitive information.

## Project Description

The Visa Scheduling Bot is designed to streamline the visa application scheduling process. It automates various tasks involved in scheduling visa appointments, making the process more efficient.
The bot runs autonomously and can be run on a task scheduler like the built in Windows task scheduler and set it to every minute. The bot would automaticaly go to the visa scheduling site and look for the earliest date it finds. The main idea is that a lot of people would cancel their appointments and this bot would use logic and comparison to go and everytime compare the current time that the user has a slot in and compare it with the earliest date it finds. If the date found is earlier than the user's current date then the bot automatically changes the scheduled time.

## Video Overview - https://github.com/ssanjan123/Visa-Scheduling-Bot/blob/main/Demo.mp4

To get an in-depth understanding of how the Visa Scheduling Bot works, I have prepared a comprehensive video demonstration. In this video, you will see the bot in action, performing various tasks related to visa appointment scheduling.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide direct access to the source code of the bot due to legal regulations and sensitive information. However, the video demonstration will give you a clear idea of its functionality and capabilities.

## How to Access the code

## Fun Personal Project

This was a fun personal project to see if I could get an earlier date for my USA Visa Appointment. I was able to convert my 1.5 years wait time to a few months wait period, that too running the bot only for a few days.
I appreciate your interest in the Visa Scheduling Bot project. While I cannot share the source code publicly, I am more than happy to provide information and engage in discussions about the project.
